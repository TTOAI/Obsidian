- The wide availability of photo and video technology on cellphones and other devices has made it possible to store images, audio clips, and video streams digitally. These types of files are becoming an important component of multimedia databases. ==Geographic information systems (GISs)== can store and analyze maps, weather data, and satellite images. Data warehouses and online analytical processing (OLAP) systems are used in many companies to extract and analyze useful business information from very large databases to support decision making. Real-time and active database technology is used to control industrial and manufacturing processes. And database search techniques are being applied to the World Wide Web to improve the search for information that is needed by users browsing the Internet.
- A database management system (DBMS) is a computerized system that enables users to create and maintain a database. The DBMS is a general-purpose software system that facilitates the processes of defining, constructing, manipulating, and sharing databases among various users and applications. Defining a database involves specifying the data types, structures, and ==constraints== of the data to be stored in the database. The database definition or descriptive information is also stored by the DBMS in the form of a ==database catalog== or dictionary; it is called ==meta-data==. Constructing the database is the process of storing the data on some storage medium that is controlled by the DBMS. Manipulating a database includes functions such as querying the database to retrieve specific data, updating the database to reflect changes in the miniworld, and generating reports from the data. Sharing a database allows multiple users and programs to access the database simultaneously.

	- Casual users and persons with occasional need for information from the database interact using the ==interactive query== interface in Figure 2.3. We have not explicitly shown any menu-based or form-based or mobile interactions that are typically used to generate the interactive query automatically or to access canned transactions. These queries are parsed and validated for correctness of the query syntax, the names of files and data elements, and so on by a ==query compiler== that compiles them into an internal form. This internal query is subjected to query optimization (discussed in Chapters 18 and 19).
	- Among other things, the ==query optimizer== is concerned with the rearrangement and possible reordering of operations, elimination of redundancies, and use of efficient search algorithms during execution. It consults the ==system catalog== for statistical and other physical information about the stored data and generates executable code that performs the necessary operations for the query and makes calls on the runtime processor.
	- Application programmers write programs in host languages such as Java, C, or C++ that are submitted to a ==precompiler==. The precompiler extracts DML commands from an application program written in a host programming language. These commands are sent to the ==DML compiler== for compilation into object code for database access. The rest of the program is sent to the ==host language compiler==. The object codes for the DML commands and the rest of the program are linked, forming a canned transaction whose executable code includes calls to the ==runtime database processor==. It is also becoming increasingly common to use scripting languages such as PHP and Python to write database programs. Canned transactions are executed repeatedly by parametric users via PCs or mobile apps; these users simply supply the parameters to the transactions. Each execution is considered to be a separate transaction. An example is a bank payment transaction where the account number, payee, and amount may be supplied as parameters.
	- In the lower part of Figure 2.3, the ==runtime database processor== executes (1) the privileged commands, (2) the executable query plans, and (3) the canned transactions with runtime parameters. It works with the ==system catalog== and may update it with statistics. It also works with the ==stored data manager==, which in turn uses basic operating system services for carrying out low-level input/output (read/write) operations between the disk and main memory. The runtime database processor handles other aspects of data transfer, such as management of buffers in the main memory. Some DBMSs have their own buffer management module whereas others depend on the OS for buffer management. We have shown ==concurrency control== and ==backup and recovery systems== separately as a module in this figure. They are integrated into the working of the runtime database processor for purposes of transaction management.
	- It is common to have the ==client program== that accesses the DBMS running on a separate computer or device from the computer on which the database resides. The former is called the ==client computer== running DBMS client software and the latter is called the ==database server==. In many cases, the client accesses a middle computer, called the ==application server==, which in turn accesses the database server. We elaborate on this topic in Section 2.5.

# 5. The Relational Data Model
- To define referential integrity more formally, first we define the concept of a foreign key. The conditions for a foreign key, given below, specify a referential integrity constraint between the two relation schemas R1 and R2. A set of attributes FK in relation schema R1 is a foreign key of R1 that references relation R2 if it satisfies the following rules:
	1. The attributes in FK have the same domain(s) as the primary key attributes PK of R2; the attributes FK are said to reference or refer to the relation R2.
	2. A value of FK in a tuple t1 of the current state r1(R1) either occurs as a value of PK for some tuple t2 in the current state r2(R2) or is NULL. In the former case, we have ==t1[FK] = t2[PK]==, and we say that the tuple t1 references or refers to the tuple t2.

- In traditional file processing, the structure of data files is embedded in the application programs, so any changes to the structure of a file may require changing all programs that access that file. By contrast, DBMS access programs do not require such changes in most cases. The structure of data files is stored in the DBMS catalog separately from the access programs. We call this property ==program-data independence==.
- r (R): a specific state (or "value" or “population”) of relation R – this is a set of tuples (rows)
- t[Ai] or t.Ai: component values of a tuple t

	- entity integrity constraint: primary key의 값은 null일 수 없다
	- Referential integrity constraint: foreign key는 반드시 참조하는 primary key 값과 일치하거나 null이어야 한다
