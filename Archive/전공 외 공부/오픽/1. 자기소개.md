Hello, I'm Juyeong Lee. I was born in Pohang in Korea.

Pohang is a really beautiful city and it's famous for historical sites named Hwasung Palace.

So I remember like back in the days when I was teenager, I spent a lot of time like jogging and running around the Hwasung Palace with my family and friends.

I recently graduated from university and I studied education.

Also, I enjoy taking on challenges. A month ago, I participated in idea contest. And I just stayed up all night with teammates and came up with creative strategy. I was really huge challenge for me and I got the grand prize. These challenges give me motivation to live passionately. And now I'm always trying to live passionately.

And I think that's all I can say about me.
